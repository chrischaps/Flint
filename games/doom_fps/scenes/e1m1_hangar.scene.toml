#  E1M1: HANGAR — Multi-Room Doom-Inspired Level
# ================================================================
#
#  A recreation of Doom's iconic opening level. Five distinct rooms
#  connected by three doors, with a secret area and a nukage-filled
#  zigzag chamber. Progression flows south to north (positive Z to
#  negative Z).
#
#  Layout (top-down):
#    Z=-25  Computer Room  (blue-gray tech, exit switch)
#    Z=-10  ──── Door 3 ────
#           Zigzag Room    (nukage pit, raised walkways)
#    Z=+5   ──── Door 2 ────
#           Hallway        (narrow gray corridor)
#    Z=+15  ──── Door 1 ────
#           Start Room     (warm brown, player spawn)
#    Z=+25
