# CLI-First Workflow

> This page is a stub. Content coming soon.

The CLI-first principle means every engine operation is available as a composable command. This page will cover:

- How CLI commands compose with pipes and shell tooling
- Structured output formats (JSON, TOML) for machine consumption
- Transaction mode for atomic multi-step operations
- Comparison with GUI-driven workflows in other engines
- Practical patterns for scripting scene construction

See [Design Principles](design-principles.md) for an overview of this philosophy.
