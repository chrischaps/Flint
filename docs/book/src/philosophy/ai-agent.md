Flint is designed to be an excellent interface for AI coding agents. This page will cover:

- Why AI agents struggle with GUI-based game engines
- The structured input/output contract Flint provides
- How the query language enables agent introspection
- Constraint validation as an automated feedback loop
- Headless rendering for visual verification
- Example agent workflows for common tasks

See the [AI Agent Workflow](../guides/ai-agent-workflow.md) guide for practical examples.
