# Building a Tavern

> This page is a stub. Content coming soon.

A step-by-step tutorial that builds a complete tavern scene from scratch using only CLI commands. This guide will cover:

- Project initialization with `flint init`
- Building rooms with parent-child hierarchies
- Placing doors with component properties
- Furnishing spaces with tables, chairs, and decorations
- Adding characters (bartender, patrons, a mysterious stranger)
- Running queries to inspect the scene
- Validating against constraints
- Viewing the result with `flint serve --watch`

This tutorial follows the same steps as the `demo/build-tavern.ps1` showcase script, explained in detail.
